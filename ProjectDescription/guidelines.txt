Use the following guidelines when developing your project:

Create a website of around 4-5 pages, or (if using a single scrolling page) these should be separate page areas.
Incorporate main navigation and grid layout (you might want to use Flexbox or Bootstrap to accomplish this).
Whenever possible, strive to use semantic HTML5 elements to structure your HTML code better.
Make sure your site is as responsive as possible. You can test this by checking the website on different screen sizes and browsers.
We advise that you write down user stories and create wireframes/mockups before embarking on full-blown development.
The site can also make use of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, just make sure you maintain a clear separation between the library code and your code.
You should conduct and document tests to ensure that all of your website’s functionality works well.
Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the need that it fulfills. It should also describe the functionality of the project, as well as the technologies used. Detail how the project was deployed and tested and if some of the work was based on other code, explain what was kept and how it was changed to fit your need. A project submitted without a README.md file will FAIL.
Use Git & GitHub for version control. Each new piece of functionality should be in a separate commit.
Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.

PLAGIARISM
It is each student’s responsibility to ensure that when they include (directly or indirectly) the work of others that this contribution is fully and adequately acknowledged and documented.

You are encouraged to ask your mentor/tutor for advice about your project work, but note that your project code should not include any code written by others unless it is explicitly credited to them with a comment above. Any such code provided by your mentor/tutor would not contribute to your assessment. Failure to attribute credit to code that isn’t yours will be considered as plagiarism and will result in a failing grade.
